## 🎯 Example Use Cases

### Case Study 1: Greenfield vs. Existing Building

**Scenario**: Comparing a greenfield site with excellent power vs. an existing warehouse with immediate availability.

**Greenfield Site Profile**:
- Power: 5.0 (pre-validated connection, 10MW available)
- Network: 3.5 (good but not exceptional)
- Property: 3.0 (land acquisition required)
- Planning: 3.5 (greenfield development risk)
- Cost: 3.0 (higher capex)
- Sustainability: 4.5 (renewable design)
- **Overall: 3.75**

**Warehouse Conversion Profile**:
- Power: 2.5 (connection study required)
- Network: 4.0 (urban location, good connectivity)
- Property: 4.5 (existing building, quick possession)
- Planning: 4.0 (existing industrial use)
- Cost: 4.0 (lower capex)
- Sustainability: 3.0 (retrofit limitations)
- **Overall: 3.67**

**Decision**: Greenfield scores higher overall, but warehouse offers faster deployment. If speed is priority, adjust weights (Property +10%, Power -10%) and warehouse becomes preferred.

### Case Study 2: Urban Edge vs. Suburban Campus

**Urban Edge Profile**:
- High network score (5.0)
- Low power score (2.0) due to grid congestion
- High cost score due to land prices
- Excellent for latency-critical applications

**Suburban Campus Profile**:
- High power score (4.5) due to grid availability
- Moderate network score (3.5)
- Lower costs
- Excellent for enterprise/private applications

**Decision Matrix**:
- Hyperscaler targeting 5G edge → Choose Urban
- Enterprise colocation/campus → Choose Suburban
- Adjust weights to reflect use case priority

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Weights Don't Total 100%

**Solution**: Adjust individual sliders. System allows flexibility but visually alerts if total ≠ 100%.

### Issue: Scores Not Saving

**Check**:
1. Browser localStorage not disabled
2. Not in private/incognito mode
3. Sufficient storage available

**Solution**: Enable localStorage or use CSV export for session data.

### Issue: Radar Chart Not Displaying

**Check**:
1. Canvas element rendering correctly
2. All criteria have scores
3. Browser supports Canvas API

**Solution**: Try different browser or export data for external visualization.

### Issue: Can't Delete Site

**Solution**: Refresh page and try again. If persists, clear localStorage and re-enter data.
